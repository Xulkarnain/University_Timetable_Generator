# 🗓️ University/College Timetable Generator (Manual + Auto)

A Java-based Timetable Generator for universities and colleges with support for both **manual** and **auto-generation** of schedules. Built with a modular code structure using **AWT for the UI** and clean object-oriented design separating logic into `Screens` and `Models`.

> ⚠️ UI is currently developed using Java AWT and will be upgraded to a modern GUI framework soon.
